# Data Engineer | Machine Learning Enthusiast

I am a results-driven Data Engineer and Machine Learning Enthusiast with extensive experience in building scalable data pipelines, designing predictive models, and delivering data-driven insights. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Apache Spark, and cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I specialize in leveraging machine learning and data engineering techniques to solve complex business challenges.

My expertise includes automating workflows with Apache Airflow, integrating and managing large datasets, and applying machine learning to real-world problems. From predictive maintenance and inventory optimization to natural language processing and computer vision, I thrive on crafting innovative solutions that drive efficiency and enable real-time decision-making.

Whether it’s training models to predict machinery failures, building causal ML models to enhance quality control, or optimizing supply chain operations with advanced analytics, I am passionate about combining cutting-edge technology with actionable insights.
